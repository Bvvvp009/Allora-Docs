# Running Blockless Nodes

# Starting Up a Minimal Cluster

For a minimal working cluster, one needs to have one head node and one worker node. For more detailed information about setting up identities and everything, refer to [this Readme](./b7s-concepts) and [the node documentation](./b7s-usage).

This section describes how to start nodes in the easiest way possible.

## Head Node

From the repo root (assuming you've built the node executable over at `/cmd/node`), run:

```shell
$ ./cmd/node/node --role head --rest-api ':8080'
{"level":"info","id":"12D3KooWLW6zn7YAcFCr5SqF2oxdyv9f1te4Q2droK62NpWupwpH","addresses":["/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/39173/p2p/12D3KooWLW6zn7YAcFCr5SqF2oxdyv9f1te4Q2droK62NpWupwpH","/ip4/172.27.145.54/tcp/39173/p2p/12D3KooWLW6zn7YAcFCr5SqF2oxdyv9f1te4Q2droK62NpWupwpH"],"boot_nodes":0,"dial_back_peers":0,"time":"2024-01-12T19:30:36+01:00","message":"created host"}
{"level":"info","port":":8080","time":"2024-01-12T19:30:36+01:00","message":"Node API starting"}
{"level":"info","role":"head","time":"2024-01-12T19:30:36+01:00","message":"Blockless Node starting"}
{"level":"info","component":"node","topics":["blockless/b7s/general"],"time":"2024-01-12T19:30:36+01:00","message":"topics node will subscribe to"}
{"level":"info","component":"node","concurrency":10,"time":"2024-01-12T19:30:36+01:00","message":"starting node main loop"}
```

Some things to take note of:

- REST API is served at port 8080 on all interfaces
- private key is not specified so node will generate a random identity (peer ID)
- listens on all interfaces
- port is not specified, so node will pick a random port

If you checkout the first log message, it will have the connection and identity info for this node:

```json
{
    "level": "info",
    "id": "12D3KooWLW6zn7YAcFCr5SqF2oxdyv9f1te4Q2droK62NpWupwpH",
    "addresses": [
        "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/39173/p2p/12D3KooWLW6zn7YAcFCr5SqF2oxdyv9f1te4Q2droK62NpWupwpH",
        "/ip4/172.27.145.54/tcp/39173/p2p/12D3KooWLW6zn7YAcFCr5SqF2oxdyv9f1te4Q2droK62NpWupwpH"
    ],
    "boot_nodes": 0,
    "dial_back_peers": 0,
    "time": "2024-01-12T19:30:36+01:00",
    "message": "created host"
}
```

The node peer ID is `12D3KooWLW6zn7YAcFCr5SqF2oxdyv9f1te4Q2droK62NpWupwpH` while `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/39173/p2p/12D3KooWLW6zn7YAcFCr5SqF2oxdyv9f1te4Q2droK62NpWupwpH` is the _multiaddress_ we use to connect to the node.

## Worker Node

Prerequisite - install [Blockless Runtime](https://github.com/blocklessnetwork/bls-runtime).

From the repo root, run:

```shell
$ ./cmd/node/node --peer-db worker-peer-db --function-db worker-function-db --workspace worker-workspace --runtime-path ~/.local/blockless-runtime/bin --runtime-cli bls-runtime --boot-nodes  /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/39173/p2p/12D3KooWLW6zn7YAcFCr5SqF2oxdyv9f1te4Q2droK62NpWupwpH
{"level":"info","id":"12D3KooWS7hQiSpq8FPeCpp6PeAkYEHpuw8opaLGAS2zzWhWgGei","addresses":["/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/37383/p2p/12D3KooWS7hQiSpq8FPeCpp6PeAkYEHpuw8opaLGAS2zzWhWgGei","/ip4/172.27.145.54/tcp/37383/p2p/12D3KooWS7hQiSpq8FPeCpp6PeAkYEHpuw8opaLGAS2zzWhWgGei"],"boot_nodes":1,"dial_back_peers":0,"time":"2024-01-12T19:33:36+01:00","message":"created host"}
{"level":"info","role":"worker","time":"2024-01-12T19:33:37+01:00","message":"Blockless Node starting"}
{"level":"info","component":"node","topics":["blockless/b7s/general"],"time":"2024-01-12T19:33:37+01:00","message":"topics node will subscribe to"}
{"level":"info","component":"node","concurrency":10,"time":"2024-01-12T19:33:37+01:00","message":"starting node main loop"}
```

Notes:

- `peer-db`, `function-db` and `workspace` are not mandatory arguments. However, since we have started the head node with the default flag values, we're changing them here so as to not cause collisions. If you don't run the risk of such collisions, you can omit these
- `runtime-path` and `runtime-cli` specify the path and name of the runtime that the worker will try to execute - the Blockless Runtime
- `boot-nodes` specifies the addresses of nodes that this node will try to connect to. In this case, we have specified the multiaddress of the head node we started in previous step

You can take note of the peer ID of our Worker node (`12D3KooWS7hQiSpq8FPeCpp6PeAkYEHpuw8opaLGAS2zzWhWgGei`) - that will come in handy later.

## Issue an Execution Request

Using cURL, you can issue an HTTP request to the head node to execute a simple _Hello World_ request:

```json
curl --location 'localhost:8080/api/v1/functions/execute' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "function_id": "bafybeia24v4czavtpjv2co3j54o4a5ztduqcpyyinerjgncx7s2s22s7ea",
    "method": "hello-world.wasm",
    "config": {
        "number_of_nodes": 1
    }
}' | jq
```

You should then see a response that looks like:

```json
{
  "code": "200",
  "request_id": "50f1228a-87d3-4b40-a950-592f388317f8",
  "results": [
    {
      "result": {
        "stdout": "Hello, world!\n",
        "stderr": "",
        "exit_code": 0
      },
      "peers": [
        "12D3KooWS7hQiSpq8FPeCpp6PeAkYEHpuw8opaLGAS2zzWhWgGei"
      ],
      "frequency": 100
    }
  ],
  "cluster": {
    "peers": [
      "12D3KooWS7hQiSpq8FPeCpp6PeAkYEHpuw8opaLGAS2zzWhWgGei"
    ]
  }
}
```

This minimal HTTP request says the following things:

- execute function with the ID (CID) of `bafybeia24v4czavtpjv2co3j54o4a5ztduqcpyyinerjgncx7s2s22s7ea`
- execute it on one node

We issue this HTTP request to the head node REST API by sending it to `localhost:8080`. Head node takes a little time, then replies back. The `request_id` field is a UUID generated to uniquely identify this execution request. The `results` field contains a list of distinct execution results, ordered by frequency in which they appear. Since here we had a single node, its execution result is the only one. Note that the ID of the peer that returned this result is the ID of our Worker node! In cases where we have multiple nodes executing requests, the `cluster` field will list all peers that participated in this execution.

If you check out the logs of the Head and Worker node, you can find a lot of interesting information about what went on with this simple request!

# Starting a Cluster with Subgroups

## Start Worker Nodes

This example builds on the previous one. Here, we'll run nodes that are part of different subgroups.

Now, let's start two more workers using a similar command line as before:

```shell
$ # worker 1
$ ./cmd/node/node --topic blockless-subgroup-1 --peer-db worker1-peer-db --function-db worker1-function-db --workspace worker1-workspace --runtime-path ~/.local/blockless-runtime/bin --runtime-cli bls-runtime --boot-nodes  /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/39173/p2p/12D3KooWLW6zn7YAcFCr5SqF2oxdyv9f1te4Q2droK62NpWupwpH

$ # worker 2
$ ./cmd/node/node --topic blockless-subgroup-2 --peer-db worker2-peer-db --function-db worker1-function-db --workspace worker2-workspace --runtime-path ~/.local/blockless-runtime/bin --runtime-cli bls-runtime --boot-nodes  /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/39173/p2p/12D3KooWLW6zn7YAcFCr5SqF2oxdyv9f1te4Q2droK62NpWupwpH

```

Note that both nodes connect to the same head node.  
One difference is in the `--topic` flag - one node makes itself part of the `blockless-subgroup-1`, while another one specifies `blockless-subgroup-2`.

If we check the node log output, it tells us to which topics it subscribes, or - which subgroups it's part of:

```json
{
    "level": "info",
    "component": "node",
    "topics": [
        "blockless-subgroup-1",
        "blockless/b7s/general"
    ],
    "time": "2024-01-12T20:04:09+01:00",
    "message": "topics node will subscribe to"
}
```

The `blockless/b7s/general` topic is the top-level group that all nodes are part of.

## Issue an Execution Request

Let's issue the same request as before, but now let's say that we want TWO nodes to execute it:

```json
curl --location 'localhost:8080/api/v1/functions/execute' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "function_id": "bafybeia24v4czavtpjv2co3j54o4a5ztduqcpyyinerjgncx7s2s22s7ea",
    "method": "hello-world.wasm",
    "config": {
        "number_of_nodes": 2
    }
}' | jq
```

The response should look like:

```json
{
  "code": "200",
  "request_id": "a2ee6c52-f895-4c51-95c2-e18194fa1232",
  "results": [
    {
      "result": {
        "stdout": "Hello, world!\n",
        "stderr": "",
        "exit_code": 0
      },
      "peers": [
        "12D3KooWNTcry5sCgP9DBykNmArMAu35mFdSmCfTjkTkWyRFyipa",
        "12D3KooWCKG1dKD6muZyz8mLJasptd4ACmrZjLHG9yXmxaU1wd9t"
      ],
      "frequency": 100
    }
  ],
  "cluster": {
    "peers": [
      "12D3KooWNTcry5sCgP9DBykNmArMAu35mFdSmCfTjkTkWyRFyipa",
      "12D3KooWCKG1dKD6muZyz8mLJasptd4ACmrZjLHG9yXmxaU1wd9t"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Issue an Execution Request to a Subgroup

Lets now tweak the execution request by specifying a subgroup. This can be done by specifying the `subgroup` field in the JSON request. Note that we've again specify we only want ONE node - this is because the subgroup only has a single node. If we'd request two nodes - our request would fail as there wouldn't be enough nodes to fulfil our requirement.

```json
{
    "subgroup": "blockless-subgroup-1",
    "function_id": "bafybeia24v4czavtpjv2co3j54o4a5ztduqcpyyinerjgncx7s2s22s7ea",
    "method": "hello-world.wasm",
    "config": {
        "number_of_nodes": 1
    }
}
```

Head node response:

```json
{
  "code": "200",
  "request_id": "5ba2c78d-6773-41a5-9eb8-1e8eef93d3f0",
  "results": [
    {
      "result": {
        "stdout": "Hello, world!\n",
        "stderr": "",
        "exit_code": 0
      },
      "peers": [
        "12D3KooWNTcry5sCgP9DBykNmArMAu35mFdSmCfTjkTkWyRFyipa"
      ],
      "frequency": 100
    }
  ],
  "cluster": {
    "peers": [
      "12D3KooWNTcry5sCgP9DBykNmArMAu35mFdSmCfTjkTkWyRFyipa"
    ]
  }
}
```

From the response it can be seen that the node that executed this work has the ID of `12D3KooWNTcry5sCgP9DBykNmArMAu35mFdSmCfTjkTkWyRFyipa`. This is because only that node makes itself available to work assigned to this subgroup.

If we repeat this query but change the `subgroup` field to `blockless-subgroup-2` the work would be tasked to the other node, in our case `12D3KooWCKG1dKD6muZyz8mLJasptd4ACmrZjLHG9yXmxaU1wd9t`.

# Allora Blockless Extension

## Blockless Extensions

Blockless Extensions provide ways of extending the capabilities of plain WebAssembly code. In particular, CGI extensions allow nodes to execute logic written in non-WebAssembly languages. You can read more about them [here](https://blockless.network/docs/network/extensions).

## Allora Blockless Extension

[Allora Blockless Extension](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-inference-extension) provides additional functionality by allowing Nodes to execute Python scripts. This extension is installed on Allora Compute Node images and will execute a `main.py` script. The `main.py` script is searched for either in the current directory or the `/app/runtime` or `/app/runtime/extensions` paths.

A Blockless Function showcasing the use of this CGI extension can be found [here](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-inference-extension/blob/main/allora-inference-function/index.ts). This function passes the arguments in the `ALLORA_ARG_PARAMS` environment variables to the `main.py` script as part of a JSON object in the "arguments" field. The Python script can read the JSON payload written to its standard input and read arbitrary data needed for execution.

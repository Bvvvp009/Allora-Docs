# Mint Parameters

> Parameters from the minting module on Allora Network

**mint_denom**

The mint denomination for the blockchain is `uallo`.

**inflation_rate_change**

Determines the maximum annual rate at which the inflation rate can change.

Value: `"0.130000000000000000"`

Standard value.  
Balances the rate of change to adapt to economic conditions while preventing sudden shocks. It will be regularly evaluated and adjusted based on economic dynamics.

**inflation_max**

Inflation max sets the maximum allowable annual inflation rate.

Value: `"0.200000000000000000"`

Standard value.  
It may be adjusted based on the balance between controlling token supply growth and incentivizing network participants.

**inflation_min**

Inflation min sets the minimum allowable annual inflation rate.

Value: `"0.070000000000000000"`

Standard value.  
It provides adequate incentives while avoiding undue token supply inflation.

**goal_bonded**

Represents the target ratio of bonded (staked) tokens to the total token supply.

Current value: `"0.670000000000000000"`

Standard value.  
It provides adequate incentives while avoiding undue token supply inflation.

**max_supply**

Maximum total supply of `uallo` 

Current value: `"1000000000000000000000000000"`

**halving_interval **

The block interval for the halving of the block reward.

Current value: `25246080`

**current_block_provision**

The initial value of provisions per block. This value is recalculated and updated with each block.

Current value: `2831000000000000000000`

**blocks_per_year** 

Value: `6311520`  (a block every ~5 seconds)

In Cronos, Treasurenet, Celestia, and many other Cosmos-based networks, the blocks per second are 5. This is the most common value for Cosmos-based blockchains.  
In Bittensor this is 12 seconds. We are allowing a higher number of topics (suggested 2048) than there are max subnets (32), so it is expected to have a higher level of activity, thus higher number of transactions - which could benefit from faster blocks.  
The standard value of a block every ~5 seconds is kept, for consistency with other blockchains and for allowing quicker block times and faster transactions than in Bittensor for the aforementioned reasons.

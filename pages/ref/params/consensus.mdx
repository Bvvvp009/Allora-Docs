# Consensus Parameters

> Parameters that uniquely affect validators of the Allora Chain

**block.max_bytes**

Sets the maximum size of a block in bytes.

Value: `22020096`

Standard value.  
This parameter limits the block size, preventing excessive network load. However, setting it too low may restrict the number of transactions in a block. The current value strikes a balance between controlling block size and allowing for sufficient transaction throughput.

**block.max_gas**

Sets the maximum amount of gas that can be used in a block.

Value: `-1`

Standard value.  
The current setting allows for flexibility by indicating no limit on the maximum gas usage in a block. While this offers freedom for transactions, careful monitoring is needed to prevent potential abuse. This approach acknowledges the need for adaptability in a dynamic network environment.

**evidence.max_age_num_blocks**

Sets the maximum age (in blocks) of evidence that can be included in a block.

Value: `100000`

Standard value.  
By limiting the age of evidence, this parameter maintains network security by preventing the inclusion of outdated evidence. The chosen value strikes a reasonable balance between retaining relevant evidence and ensuring integrity of the network.

**evidence.max_age_duration**

Sets the maximum age (in nanoseconds) of evidence that can be included in a block.

Value: `172800000000000`

Standard value.  
This parameter complements `max_age_num_blocks` by providing an additional measure to limit the inclusion of outdated evidence. The current setting aligns with the need for a comprehensive yet controlled approach to evidence inclusion.

**evidence.max_bytes**

Sets the maximum size of evidence in bytes.

Value: `1048576`

Standard value.  
Controlling the size of evidence prevents potential abuse and ensures efficient network operation. While too low a value may restrict the inclusion of legitimate evidence, the current setting finds a suitable compromise between limiting size and maintaining the effectiveness of the evidence mechanism.

**validator.pub_key_types**

Specifies the supported public key types for validators.

Value: `["ed25519"]`

Standard value.  
This parameter enhances security by explicitly specifying the supported public key type for validators.

# What is a Data Provider?

The primary goal of Allora is to be the marketplace for intelligence. Allora aims to incentivize data scientists (workers) to provide high-quality inferences as consumers request them. High-quality inferences require high-quality data. This article outlines the process and requirements for becoming a data provider within the Allora ecosystem. Data Providers are crucial in enhancing the network's machine intelligence capabilities by contributing data. 

# Role Definition

Data providers on the Allora Network supply high-quality, relevant data essential for training machine learning models and making accurate predictions. This data can vary widely, including but not limited to price series, asset attributes, fundamental ratios, events like Bitcoin ETF approvals, sentiment indicators, and much more. A data provider may be either an individual or a group with access to proprietary datasets. 

## Advantages of Being a Data Provider

### Distribution and Accessibility

By participating in the Allora Network, data providers contribute to a more open and accessible ecosystem. This democratizes access to machine intelligence, allowing it to integrate more deeply into the economy, technology, and society. Once a data provider is integrated into Allora, an official page will redirect Allora's users to their website. 

### The Reputer Role

Data providers also have the opportunity to act as Reputers. Reputers validate the accuracy of predictions and inferences made within the network, providing an additional layer of trust and security. This role comes with its own set of rewards and responsibilities. More details [can be found here](https://docs.allora.network/docs/technical-architecture-v2).

### Incentives

Data providers are incentivized through a differentiated structure that rewards contributions based on the value they add to the network. This ensures fair compensation for the data provided and its impact on the network's performance. Payment for data is not enforced in the protocol and can be settled out-of-band. Incentives for Reputers [are detailed here](technical-architecture-v2#rewards).

## Requirements for Data Providers

### Latency

The latency requirements for providing data depend on the specific needs of the supported forecasting or prediction models. This can vary from near real-time data for minute-ahead predictions to less frequent updates for day-ahead forecasts. 

### Formatting and Historical Data

Data must be provided in a structured, easily consumable format, such as CSV, JSON, or through APIs. Historical data is crucial for training and refining models, and while the delivery method may vary (API, FTP, etc.), the data should be comprehensive and accurate. 

### Ground Truth

For certain predictions, especially those related to financial assets, the ground truth might be a historical price series or a list of transactions. This information is vital for validating the accuracy of models and inferences. 

## Architecture/Deployment

The Allora Network's decentralized nature requires data providers to integrate their systems in a way that supports secure and reliable data transfer. While specifics may vary based on the data and models involved, standard methods include API access with authentication keys, direct database connections, or file transfers. 

## Walkthrough Example

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure your data meets the Allora Network's latency, formatting, and relevance requirements. This might include aggregating historical data, setting up real-time data feeds, or formatting data into the required structures. 
2. **Integration**: Choose the most appropriate method for your data delivery, such as API, FTP, or direct database access. Implement the necessary security measures, such as authentication keys. 
3. **Testing and Validation**: Before officially becoming a data provider, test the data transfer process to ensure reliability, accuracy, and timeliness. This may involve coordination with Allora Network representatives, other workers, and reputers, or participating in a sandbox environment. You can find more info below.
4. **Deployment**: Once testing is complete and integration is verified, deploy the data provision system. This includes ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure data quality and system reliability. 

Consider the example of our [ETH price prediction worker](https://dash.readme.com/project/allora/v1.0/docs/walkthrough-for-running-an-ethereum-price-prediction-node), which utilizes Binance as a data provider for price feeds. The data is accessed [via an API](https://github.com/allora-network/basic-coin-prediction-node/blob/main/updater.py#L22), [organized](https://github.com/allora-network/basic-coin-prediction-node/blob/main/model.py#L36) by the model creator, and employed [to train the model](https://github.com/allora-network/basic-coin-prediction-node/blob/main/model.py#L75), facilitating a smooth integration process.

# Allora Appchain CLI Spec

> Install the allorad binary for interacting with Allora via a CLI

The Appchain CLI is an easy means of interacting with the Allora Network. It can be used to read and write data to the chain, e.g. to read the distribution of weights across workers or to create new topics. In this page, we'll discuss how to set up `allorad`, which is the tool synonymous with the Appchain CLI, then enumerate all queries and transactions unique to Allora that can be run with it.

# Install

```Text bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allora-network/allora-chain/main/install.sh | bash -s -- v0.2.7

```

A **successful** installation should output the following line:

```bash
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss (N MB/s) - ‘/tmp/allorad’ saved [116706514/116706514]
```

# Build Requirements and Setup

The installation process is optimized for Linux distributions, with Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS as the reference environment. Installation is also supported on Unix systems. Windows users may need to use third-party tools, which are not officially supported. The instructions below guide you through a clean installation.

## Update & Install Build Tools

To begin, update your system and install the essential build tools:

### Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install -y make gcc
```

## Install Go

`allorad` requires Go version 1.21 or newer to ensure compatibility and performance.

To install Go, follow one of the recommended methods below or consult the [official Go documentation](https://go.dev/doc/install) for the correct download for your operating system. The command-line instructions are based on standard installation locations, but you may customize them as needed.

### Go Binary Downloads

On Ubuntu, you would download and set up Go as follows, adjusting for the latest version available:

```
curl -OL <https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.linux-amd64.tar.gz>  
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf go1.21.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Add Go to your PATH to facilitate command execution:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

## Install `allorad` Binaries

Proceed to install the latest `allorad` version, ensuring you clone the correct version tag from the repository:

```
git clone -b <latest-release-tag> https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain.git
cd allora-chain && make all
```

### Verifying Installation

After installation, verify that `allorad` is correctly installed and ready to interact with the Allora Network by running:

```
allorad version
```

`allorad` supports general Cosmos SDK and Tendermint commands. You can run the tool to see a list of commands with explanations of what they do:

```text
$ allorad
allorad - the Allora chain

  allorad [command]

Use "allorad [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

# Running Commands

You can then interact with the chain as follows.

In the code below, note that `RPC_URL` defaults to localhost, which you may not have running. We'll release a list of supported RPC endpoints for public use shortly.

## Queries

To query the chain e.g. to [get the next topic id](./cli#get-next-topic-id), one can run:

```shell
allorad q emissions next-topic-id --node <RPC_URL>
```

## Create a wallet

 Prior to start with transactions, a wallet must be created by running:

```shell
allorad keys add testkey
```

Learn more about setting up keys [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/user/run-node/keyring).

Make sure you save your mnemomic and account information safely.

## Transactions

Transactions involve some extra steps. Then, for testnet, head over to [our faucet](https://faucet.testnet.allora.network) or, for mainnet, an exchange (TBA) to grab some coins to pay for gas and other interactions. Then, to run a transaction, e.g. to [create a topic](../devs/how-to-create-topic), one can run:

```shell
allorad tx emissions create-topic <YOUR_ADDRESS> allo15lln03gdcyudj4qd3fl3lh7uxh9au7rt3pvlja "ETH prediction in 24h" "bafybeid7mmrv5qr4w5un6c64a6kt2y4vce2vylsmfvnjt7z2wodngknway" "loss-calculation-eth.wasm" "bafybeigpiwl3o73zvvl6dxdqu7zqcub5mhg65jiky2xqb4rdhfmikswzqm" "allora-inference-function.wasm" 3600 0 "ETH" 3 1 true --node <RPC_URL> --chain-id <CHAIN_ID>
```

Be sure to swap out `RPC_URL`, `YOUR_ADDRESS`, `CHAIN_ID` and all other arguments as appropriate with the desired values.

#### Testnet

- **RPC_URL**: https://allora-rpc.testnet.allora.network/
- **CHAIN_ID**: `testnet`

#### Edgenet

- **RPC_URL**: https://allora-rpc.edgenet.allora.network/
- **CHAIN_ID**: `edgenet`

{/* #### Testnet v2

- **RPC_URL**: https://allora-rpc.edgenet.allora.network/
- **CHAIN_ID**: `v2testnet` */}

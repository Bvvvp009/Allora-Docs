# Allora Consumers

An Allora Consumer is a smart contract that allows predictions from the Allora Network to be used on a target chain. Allora Consumers are deployed to chains where Allora predictions can be used. Additional chains can be supported by coding and deploying additional adapter contracts. An adapter can be deployed to an EVM chain by following the directions [here](../devs/deploy-adapter).

The consumer contract pulls data from the Allora Network through the local bridge contract, verifies that it is signed correctly, and makes it available to the end user. You can follow [this walkthrough](../devs/walkthrough-use-topic-inference) or [this one](../devs/walkthrough-use-existing-topic-inference) to get started.

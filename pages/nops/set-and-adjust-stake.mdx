# Set and Adjust Stake

> We define stake, motivate its use, and demonstrate how it can be adjusted

## What is stake?

Stake is used to signal confidence. An inference node (worker) stands to earn more rewards when they stake more on themselves. Similarly, a reputer earns more rewards if they stake on a more-accurate worker.

Stake also protects Allora from malicious behavior, such as sybil attacks. We require all types of nodes to register on the chain before they can earn any rewards. Registering requires staking at least a minimum stake. As a result, creating an army of malicious nodes would quickly become prohibitively expensive.

## How to adjust stake

The [Allora appchain CLI spec](cli-spec) lists functions that can be used to adjust stake or help inform how one should adjust their stake

1. [Query recent inferences](cli-spec#get-inference). One can evaluate workers' abilities by viewing recent inferences and comparing them against one's expectations or revealed ground truth. These evaluations determine how much stake one should be willing to place in oneself or another worker to get the highest return.
2. [Querying weights](cli-spec#get-weight). One can learn about whose inferences the crowd values the most by viewing the current distribution of weights across workers. Like any actor, the revealed preferences of an incentive-compatible crowd likely indicate how one should adjust their stake. Learn more about weights [here](technical-architecture#weights).
3. [Register as a reputer](cli-spec#register-network-actor). Reputers can begin to earn rewards for staking on accurate workers after registering, which involves setting a minimum stake.
4. [Register as a worker](cli-spec#register-network-actor). Workers can begin to earn rewards for producing accurate inferences after registering, which involves setting a minimum stake.
5. [Add stake](cli-spec#add-stake)
6. [Remove stake](cli-spec#remove-stake)
7. [Remove all stake](cli-spec#remove-all-stake)

## Bridging funds to stake

One must port their funds from an external chain to set a stake in Allora. This section will be updated once the chain is up and running and bridging has been established.

# Connecting a Worker to the Allora Netwokr

> Nodes can participate in the Allora network and receive rewards for their inference work

While a network of workers and heads can run in isolation, its ultimate purpose is to be connected to the Allora network to receive inference requests, provide inferences and receive rewards.

## Node registration

Both heads and workers need to be registered on chain to participate in the network. 

This is done via the usage of `--allora-` flags on the head and worker.

## Allora flags

The whole set of options can be seen by running `allora-node --help`. The most important ones are

`--allora-node-rpc-address` : The address for the client to connect to an Allora Blockchain node. (default "http\://localhost:26657")

`--allora-chain-home-dir`: The Home folder of the client. It will use the user home if not set.

`--allora-chain-key-name`: The name of the key stored in the Allora Blockchain Wallet.

`--allora-chain-restore-mnemonic` : The restore mnemonic for an Allora Blockchain Wallet

`--allora-chain-account-password` :  The password for an Allora Blockchain Wallet Key

### Worker only

The worker needs to subscribe itself to a certain topic in order to provide inferences for it.

`--allora-chain-topic-id`: The topic id for the topic that the node will subscribe to and provide inferences for.

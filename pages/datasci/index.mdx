# For Data Scientists

> For those with machine learning talent or unique insights to offer

As a data scientist, your expertise in AI and ML is invaluable to this network, enabling you to contribute predictive models and insights that power a wide range of applications. The Allora Network, powered by Allora's unique consensus mechanism, crowdsources financial predictions produced by machine learning models. The network incentivizes the contribution of machine intelligence to optimize various financial objectives. 

Your goal is to produce these predictions through Inferences to the network. Validators validate the Inferences, and you receive rewards based on the quality of Inference provided by your model to the network with respect to later-revealed ground truth.

# Reputers

Reputers ensure the accuracy and reliability of worker inferences and the overall integrity of topics. 

## What do Reputers do?

### Source Ground Truth

Reputers source the ground truth as specified by the [topic metadata](/devs/topic-creators/how-to-create-topic#creating-your-first-topic). 
For example, they might retrieve the actual price of ETH at a specific moment in time. 

This ground truth is essential for evaluating the accuracy of inferences made by workers.

### Calculate Loss

Reputers calculate the loss of worker inferences and forecast-implied inferences relative to the ground truth. 

For instance, if a topic's [loss function](/devs/topic-creators/create-deploy-loss-calculation-function) is an L1-norm, reputers apply this norm to each worker's inference and the actual price of ETH in 10 days. 
They then respond with a ValueBundle of losses, detailing the calculated losses for each inference.

### Secure Topics with Stake

Reputers secure topics with their [stake](/devs/reputers/set-and-adjust-stake). The more a reputer stakes in a topic, the greater their influence on the consensus of losses. 

Additionally, reputers can be [delegated to](/devs/reference/allorad#delegate-stake-to-a-reputer-for-a-topic), increasing their ability to secure the topic further. This delegated stake enhances the extent to which reputers secure the topic 
as opposed to the broader chain security.

### Receive Rewards

Reputers [receive rewards](/home/layers/consensus/reputers) based on how close their reported losses are to the consensus. A stake-weighted average of each reported loss is taken among reputers per topic per epoch. The closer a reputer's values are to this average, the more they are rewarded. 

This system incentivizes reputers to provide accurate and reliable loss calculations, contributing to the network's overall integrity and reliability.

# API Authentication

To access the Allora API, you need to authenticate your requests using an API key. This page explains how to obtain and use an API key for the Allora API.

## Obtaining an API Key

You can obtain an API key through the Allora API key management system. Contact the Allora team for access to API keys.

## Using an API Key

Once you have an API key, you can include it in your API requests using the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  --url 'https://api.upshot.xyz/v2/allora/consumer/<chainId>?allora_topic_id=<topicId>' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: <apiKey>'
```

Replace `<apiKey>` with your actual API key, `<chainId>` with the chain ID (e.g., `ethereum-11155111` for Sepolia), and `<topicId>` with the topic ID you want to query.

## API Key Security

Your API key is a sensitive credential that should be kept secure. Do not share your API key or commit it to version control systems. Instead, use environment variables or secure credential storage mechanisms to manage your API key.

```javascript
// Example of using an environment variable for API key
const apiKey = process.env.ALLORA_API_KEY;
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting. If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a 429 Too Many Requests response. To avoid rate limiting issues, consider implementing retry logic with exponential backoff in your applications.

# Set and Adjust Stake

> We define stake, motivate its use, and demonstrate how it can be adjusted

## How Stake works for Reputers

[Stake](/home/key-terms#stake) is used to signal confidence. A reputer earns more rewards based on their accuracy comparative to consensus (the other reputers providing data for a topic) and stake.

Stake also protects Allora from malicious behavior, such as sybil attacks. We require all types of nodes to register on the chain before they can earn any rewards. Registering requires staking at least a minimum amount of ALLO. As a result, creating an army of malicious nodes would quickly become prohibitively expensive.

## Prerequisites

- [`allorad` CLI](/devs/get-started/cli)

## Tx Functions

These functions read from the appchain only and do not write. Add the **Command** value into your query to retrieve the expected data.

```bash
allorad tx emissions [Command] --node <RPC_URL>
```

# Set and Adjust Stake

> We define stake, motivate its use, and demonstrate how it can be adjusted

## How Stake works for Reputers

Stake is used to signal confidence. A reputer earns more rewards based on their accuracy comparative to consensus (the other reputers providing data for a topic) and [stake](/home/key-terms#stake).

Stake also protects Allora from malicious behavior, such as sybil attacks. We require all types of nodes to register on the chain before they can earn any rewards. Registering requires staking at least a minimum amount of ALLO. As a result, creating an army of malicious nodes would quickly become prohibitively expensive.

## How to adjust stake

The [Allora appchain CLI spec](../learn/cli) lists functions that can be used to adjust stake or help inform how one should adjust their stake

1. [Query recent inferences](/devs/consumers/onchain-query-existing-data). One can evaluate workers' abilities by viewing recent inferences and comparing them against one's expectations or revealed ground truth. These evaluations determine how much stake one should be willing to place in oneself or another worker to get the highest return.
2. [Querying weights](/devs/consumers/onchain-query-existing-data). One can learn about whose inferences the crowd values the most by viewing the current distribution of weights across workers. Like any actor, the revealed preferences of an incentive-compatible crowd likely indicate how one should adjust their stake.
3. [Register as a reputer](/devs/reputers/register-reputer-node). Reputers can begin to earn rewards for staking on accurate workers after registering, which involves setting a minimum stake.
4. [Add stake](/devs/reference/allorad#add-stake)
5. [Remove stake](/devs/reference/allorad#remove-stake-from-a-topic)

## Bridging funds to stake

One must port their funds from an external chain to set a stake in Allora. This section will be updated once the chain is up and running and bridging has been established.

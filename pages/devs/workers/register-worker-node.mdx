# Register a Worker Node

Registering a worker node on the Allora Network requires downloading the `allorad` blockchain client, creating and backup up a blockchain key, funding that key, and then configuring your worker node.

- Install the `allorad` client by following the instructions [here](/devs/get-started/installation/cli#installing-allorad)
- Using the `allorad` application, create a new key. Take note of the mnemonic restore phrase. It will be needed for the configuration options to start the node.
- ```Text bash
  allorad keys add myNewNode
  ```
- Fund the Key on the network environment you plan to run the worker, (i.e. testnet faucet, the worker will be running on testnet). One can obtain funds on our testnet through our faucet as [explained here](../devs/how-to-use-faucet).
- The node will initialize and verify its registration on the chain, and then attempt a registration transaction using the provided configuration. As long as the account is funded, this registration process should be seamless, and the node should automatically update when needed through this path.
- When initializing the node, you need to use allora flags to be able to successfully register. The whole set of options can be seen by running `allora-node --help`. The most important ones are:
- ```Text bash
  --allora-chain-home-dir /data/.allorad                       #The home folder of the client, use the user home if not set
  --allora-chain-key-name "mNodeKey"                			 #The name of a key stored in the Allora Blockchain Wallet
  --allora-chain-restore-mnemonic "roses turkeys ..."   		 #The restore mnemonic for an Allora Blockchain Wallet
  --allora-chain-account-password 12345                        #The password for an Allora Blockchain Wallet Key
  --allora-node-rpc-address "https://some-allora-rpc-address"  #The address for the client to connect to a node (default "http://localhost:26657") 
  --allora-chain-worker-mode "worker"                          #The type of node to be registered
  ```
- The worker needs to subscribe itself to a certain topic in order to provide inferences for it.

`--allora-chain-topic-id "1"`: The topic id for the topic that the node will subscribe to and provide inferences for.

The node will create a registration to the Allora L1 using this key information for registration.

- Add an Off-Chain boot node, to connect to the worker messaging queues. The Allora Network is a dual P2P network. You're worker node will need to boot to the mesh, and listen for coordination and work from other off-chain nodes.
- ```Text bash
  --boot-nodes /dns4/heads.testnet.allora.network/tcp/9527/p2p/12D3KooWH9GerdSEroL2nqjpd2GuE5dwmqNi7uHX7FoywBdKcP4q
  ```

## Using Docker to Access `allora-node`

You will need to access the node's command line in order to register it. To access `allora-node` using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Run the following commands to obtain the `container-id` of the specific node you want to register
```bash
$ docker compose up
$ docker ps       # choose container
```

2. Once you have the `container-id`, access the node's command line

```bash
$ docker exec -it <container_id> bash
~$ allora-node --help
```

## Register the Node

A completed startup command should resemble the following

```Text bash
allora-node \
--role=worker \
--peer-db=/tmp/pdb \
--function-db=/tmp/fdb \
--runtime-path=/app/runtime \
--runtime-cli=bls-runtime \
--workspace=workspace \
--private-key=/data/keys/priv.bin \
--log-level=debug \
--port=9010 \
--boot-nodes=/dns4/heads.testnet.allora.network/tcp/9527/p2p/12D3KooWH9GerdSEroL2nqjpd2GuE5dwmqNi7uHX7FoywBdKcP4q \
--topic=allora-topic-1-worker \
--allora-chain-home-dir=/data/.allorad \
--allora-node-rpc-address=https://some-allora-rpc-address \
--allora-chain-key-name=mNodeKey \
--allora-chain-topic-id=1 
```

### Keys and Signing Methods

For both workers and reputers, two set of keys are needed. 

1. Allora keys, which are regular ECDSA Cosmos-based appchain keys. Allora keys are used for communication with the chain.
2. Blockless keys, which are [p2p peer](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/peers/) keys. Blockless keys are used for communication with other Allora Network blockless-based nodes, including head, worker, and reputer nodes.

### Token rewards overview

Workers will [receive rewards](/home/layers/consensus/workers) based on their performance in inference and forecasting tasks, measured as losses in relation to the network values. Reputers will [receive rewards](/home/layers/consensus/reputers) based on their stake and the consensus between its evaluations and those of other reputers. The network supports [stake delegation](/devs/reference/allorad#delegate-stake-to-a-reputer-for-a-topic). Rewards are sent to the Allora Network balance.

# Build and Deploy a Worker Node using Docker

This document outlines a setup where the worker node is supported by an inference server. Communication occurs through an endpoint, allowing the worker to request inferences from the server.

To build this setup, please follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Git
- Go (version 1.16 or later)
- Docker

## Clone the `allora-offchain-node` Repository

Download the `allora-offchain-node` git repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allora-network/allora-offchain-node
cd allora-offchain-node
```

## Configure Your Environment

1. Copy `config.example.json` and name the copy `config.json`.
2. Open `config.json` and **update** the necessary fields inside the `wallet` sub-object and `worker` config with your specific values:

### `wallet` Sub-object

1. `nodeRpc`: The [RPC URL](/devs/get-started/setup-wallet#rpc-url-and-chain-id) for the corresponding network the node will be deployed on
2. `addressKeyName`: The name you gave your wallet key when [setting up your wallet](/devs/get-started/setup-wallet)
3. `addressRestoreMnemonic`: The mnemonic that was outputted when setting up a new key

{/* <Callout type="info">
`addressKeyName` and `addressRestoreMnemonic` are optional parameters. If you did not previously generate keys, keys will be generated for you when [running the node](/devs/workers/deploy-worker/using-docker#generate-keys-and-export-variables).

If you have existing keys that you wish to use, you will need to provide these variables.
</Callout> */}

### `worker` Config

1. `topicId`: The specific topic ID you created the worker for. 
2. `InferenceEndpoint`: The endpoint exposed by your worker node to provide inferences to the network.
3. `Token`: The token for the specific topic you are providing inferences for. The token needs to be exposed in the inference server endpoint for retrieval.
  - The `Token` variable is specific to the endpoint you expose in your `main.py` file. It is not related to any topic parameter.

<Callout type="warning">
The `worker` config is an array of sub-objects, each representing a different topic ID. This structure allows you to manage multiple topic IDs, each within its own sub-object.

To deploy a worker that provides inferences for multiple topics, you can duplicate the existing sub-object and add it to the `worker` array. Update the `topicId`, `InferenceEndpoint` and `Token` fields with the appropriate values for each new topic:
```json
"worker": [
      {
        "topicId": 1,
        "inferenceEntrypointName": "api-worker-reputer",
        "loopSeconds": 5,
        "parameters": {
          "InferenceEndpoint": "http://localhost:8000/inference/{Token}",
          "Token": "ETH"
        }
      },
      // worker providing inferences for topic ID 2
      {
        "topicId": 2, 
        "inferenceEntrypointName": "api-worker-reputer",
        "loopSeconds": 5,
        "parameters": {
          "InferenceEndpoint": "http://localhost:8000/inference/{Token}", // the specific endpoint providing inferences
          "Token": "ETH" // The token specified in the endpoint
        }
      }
    ],
```
</Callout>

### Reputer Config

The `config.example.json` file that was copied and edited in the previous steps also contains a JSON object for configuring and deploying a [reputer](/devs/reputers/reputers). To ignore the reputer and only deploy a worker, delete the reputer sub-object from the `config.json` file.

## Create the Inference Server

### Prepare the API Gateway

Ensure you have an API gateway or server that can accept API requests to call your model. 

<Callout>
The model in `allora-offchain-node` is barebones and outputs a random integer. Follow the model built in [`basic-coin-prediction-node`](https://github.com/allora-network/basic-coin-prediction-node) as an example for a full model that uses linear regression to provide an inference.

A full breakdown of the components needed to build the model is available [here](/devs/workers/walkthroughs/walkthrough-price-prediction-worker).
</Callout>

### Server Responsibilities

- Accept API requests from `main.go`.
- Respond with the corresponding inference obtained from the model.

### Inference Relay

Below is a sample structure of what your `main.go`, `main.py` and Dockerfile will look like.

#### `main.go`

`allora-offchain-node` comes preconfigured with a `main.go` file inside the [`adapter/api-worker-reputer` folder](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-offchain-node/blob/dev/adapter/api-worker-reputer/main.go).

The `main.go` file fetches the responses outputted from the Inference Endpoint based on the `InferenceEndpoint` and `Token` provided in the section above.

#### `main.py`

`allora-offchain-node` comes preconfigured with a Flask application that uses a `main.py` file to expose the Inference Endpoint. 

The Flask application serves the request from `main.go`, which is routed to the `get_inference`  function using the required argument (`Token`). Before proceeding, ensure that all necessary packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```python
from flask import Flask
from model import get_inference  # Importing the hypothetical model

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('inference/<argument>')
def get_inference(param):
    random_float = str(random.uniform(0.0, 100.0))
    return random_float

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

<Callout type="warning">

</Callout>



#### `Dockerfile`

A sample Dockerfile has been created in `allora-offchain-node` that can be used to deploy your model on port 8000.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

## Running the Node

Now that the node is configured, let's deploy and register it to the network. To run the node, follow these steps:

### Export Variables

Execute the following command from the root directory:

```sh
chmod +x init.config
./init.config 
```

This command will automatically export the necessary variables from the account created. These variables are used by the offchain node and are bundled with your provided `config.json`, then passed to the node as environment variables.

<Callout>
If you need to **make changes** to your `config.json` file after you ran the `init.config` command, rerun: 

```sh
chmod +x init.config
./init.config 
```

before proceeding.

</Callout>

### Request from Faucet

Copy your Allora address and request some tokens from the [Allora Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.allora.network/) to register your worker in the next step successfully.

### Deploy the Node

```
docker compose up --build
```

Both the offchain node and the source services will be started. They will communicate through endpoints attached to the internal DNS.

If your node is working correctly, you should see it actively checking for the active worker nonce:

```bash
offchain_node    | {"level":"debug","topicId":1,"time":1723043600,"message":"Checking for latest open worker nonce on topic"}
```

A **successful** response from your Worker should display:

```bash
{"level":"debug","msg":"Send Worker Data to chain","txHash":<tx-hash>,"time":<timestamp>,"message":"Success"}
```

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed and registered your node on Allora.

### Testing

You can test your local inference server by performing a `GET` request on `http://localhost:8000/inference/<token>`.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/inference/<token>
```

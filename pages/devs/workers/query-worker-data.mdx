# How to Query Worker Data using `allorad`

Below is a list of commands to understand how to pull information about workers via [`allorad`](/devs/get-started/cli#installing-allorad):

## Prerequisites

- [`allorad` CLI](/devs/get-started/cli)
- A basic understanding of the Allora Network

## Query Functions

These functions read from the appchain only and do not write. Add the **Command** value into your query to retrieve the expected data.

```bash
allorad q emissions [Command] --node <RPC_URL>
```

## Check if Worker is Registered in a Topic

- **RPC Method:** `IsWorkerRegisteredInTopicId`
- **Command:** `is-worker-registered [topic_id] [address]`
- **Description:** Checks whether a worker is registered in a specific topic. It returns `true` if the worker is registered in the given topic, and `false` otherwise.
- **Positional Arguments:**
    - `topic_id`: The identifier of the topic where you want to check the worker’s registration status.
    - `address`: The address of the worker you want to check.

### Use Case:
**Why use it?**  
- This command is essential if you want to verify whether a worker is properly registered in a specific topic before submitting inferences or participating in a topic's operations.

**Example Scenario:**  
- Before deploying a worker to submit inferences on a particular topic, you can confirm that the worker is registered to that topic to ensure proper functionality and avoid errors.

## Get Worker Inferences Scores at Block

- **RPC Method:** `GetWorkerInferenceScoresAtBlock`
- **Command:** `inference-scores [topic_id] [block_height]`
- **Description:** Return scores for a worker at a block height.
    - Scores determine how [worker rewards](/home/layers/consensus/workers) are paid out.

- **Positional Arguments:**
  - `topic_id` Identifier of the topic whose information will be returned.
  - `block_height` Block height to query.

### Use Case
**Why use it?**  
- You may want to verify if a worker has received a high score at a specific block, particularly if you're troubleshooting worker rewards or performance discrepancies.
   
**Example Scenario:**  
- If you believe your worker's reward for a particular topic is inaccurate, use this command to view how it was scored at a specific block.

## Get Latest Worker Inference By Topic ID

- **RPC Method:** `GetWorkerLatestInferenceByTopicId`
- **Command:** `worker-latest-inference [topic_id] [worker_address]`
- **Description:** Gets the latest inference for a given worker and topic.

- **Positional Arguments:**
  - `topic_id` Identifier of the topic whose information will be returned
  - `worker_address` Given worker to query on

### Use Case
**Why use it?**
- This command is useful if you want to check whether a worker is actively submitting inferences for a topic and how recent those inferences are.

**Example Scenario:**
- A worker has missed rewards, and you want to verify if their latest inference was successfully submitted on time for a given topic.

## Get Worker Node Info

- **RPC Method:** `GetWorkerNodeInfo`
- **Command:** `worker-info [address]`
- **Description:** Get node info for a specified worker node.
  - Returns the **owner address** of the worker node.
  - Returns the **worker node address** being queried.

- **Positional Arguments:**
  - `address` The address of the worker node whose information will be retrieved.

### Use Case
**Why use it?**
- This command is helpful for checking the current status of a worker node, especially if you are managing multiple nodes and want to verify the ownership or troubleshoot node configuration.

**Example Scenario:**
- You want to ensure the node you’ve set up is operating under the correct owner and is correctly registered on the network.

## Get Naive Inferer Network Regret

- **RPC Method:** `GetNaiveInfererNetworkRegret`
- **Command:** `naive-inferer-network-regret [topic_id] [inferer]`
- **Description:** Returns the network regret associated with including an inferer's naive inference in a batch for a given topic. If no specific regret is calculated, the command defaults to the topic's `InitialRegret` value.
- **Positional Arguments:**
    - `topic_id`: The identifier of the topic for which the regret will be calculated.
    - `inferer`: The address of the inferer whose naive inference is being evaluated.

### Use Case:
**Why use it?**  
- Use this command to assess the [regret](/home/key-terms#regrets) associated with incorporating an inferer’s naive inference into a batch. Useful for analyzing how poorly an inference may perform within the context of the network’s aggregate inference for a topic.

**Example Scenario:**  
- If you want to understand how an inferer's baseline performance impacts the network outcome, this command helps quantify that penalty.

## Get One-Out Inferer-Inferer Network Regret

- **RPC Method:** `GetOneOutInfererInfererNetworkRegret`
- **Command:** `one-out-inferer-inferer-network-regret [topic_id] [one_out_inferer] [inferer]`
- **Description:** Returns the network regret when the implied outcome of the `one_out_inferer` is included in a batch alongside the `inferer`. If no specific regret value exists, it defaults to the topic’s `InitialRegret`.
- **Positional Arguments:**
    - `topic_id`: The identifier of the topic for which the regret will be calculated.
    - `one_out_inferer`: The address of the inferer whose implied inference is being evaluated.
    - `inferer`: The address of the inferer to compare against.

### Use Case:
**Why use it?**  
- This command is useful when comparing how two inferers impact the network when their inferences are processed together. It helps identify the potential penalty on network performance when adding a specific inferer to a batch.

**Example Scenario:**
- You might want to compare the impact of two inferers to see how their joint performance influences the overall network regret. This is particularly useful for optimizing inference strategies.

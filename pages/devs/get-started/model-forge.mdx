# Model Forge Quickstart

The [Allora Model Forge Competition](https://forge.allora.network) is an open-source hackathon where participants attempt to create the best model for a given [topic](/devs/topic-creators/topic-life-cycle) on the Allora Network.

- Inferences are submitted to the Allora Network.
- Participants are scored based on the accuracy of their model compared to the ground truth, and rewarded accordingly.

## Topics

The Allora Network is categorized into distinct [topics](/devs/topic-creators/how-to-create-topic) that serve as schelling-points for model-makers to submit inferences on.

Topics are assigned an ID and categorized by a specific Target Variable, Epoch, Loss Method, and Metadata. Let's quickly explain each in the context of the Forge Competition:

- **Topic ID**: A unique identifier for the topic that participants will need to submit inferences on.
- **Target Variable**: The asset or asset pair that models are trying to predict for
  - E.g. `ETH`, `USDC/ETH`.
- **Epoch**: A discrete period during which inferences and forecasts are submitted, and rewards are distributed. 
  - Epochs are defined in blocks on the Network
  - Each epoch provides a timeframe for evaluating and scoring the performance of workers and reputers.
  - In the Forge Competition, epochs are are abstracted into universal timeframes, e.g. `5min`, `1hr`, `1day`.
- **Loss Function**: Measures how far off your model's predictions are from the actual values
  - For all topics in the Forge Competition, the loss function is [`Mean Squared Error`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error).
- **Metadata**: Additional information about the topic, including the financial indicator, abstracted epoch length, and target variable.
  - E.g. ETH 5min Volatility Prediction

<Callout>
[Additional fields that define a given topic](/devs/topic-creators/how-to-create-topic) can be pulled using the following [`allorad`](/devs/get-started/model-forge#download-the-allorad-cli-tool) command:

```bash
allorad query emissions topic <topic-id> --node <node-url>
```

- `node-rpc` is the RPC URL of the Allora Network node you are querying.

### Competition Topics

| Topic ID | Topic | Target Variable | Epoch | Loss Function | Metadata |
|----------|-------|----------------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| 13 | ETH Price Prediction | `ETH` | `5min` | Mean Squared Error | ETH 5min Price Prediction |
| Coming Soon | USDC/ETH Volume Prediction | `USDC/ETH` | `5min` | Mean Squared Error | USDC/ETH 5min Volume Prediction |
| 15 | ETH Volatility Prediction | `ETH` | `5min` | Mean Squared Error | ETH 5min Volatility Prediction |

## Getting Started

### Creating a Wallet

To get started, you'll need to create a wallet on the Allora Network.

#### Download the `allorad` CLI Tool

Open your terminal and run the following command to install the `allorad` CLI tool.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allora-network/allora-chain/main/install.sh | bash -s -- v0.8.0
```

#### Create a Wallet

Run the following command to create a wallet.

```bash
allorad keys add <key-name>
```

Save your key name, wallet address, and mnemonic in a secure location. You will need this to submit inferences to the Allora Network.

### Register for the Competition

To register for the competition, go to the [Sign Up](https://vk4z45e3hne.typeform.com/to/ypA2Yl1J?utm_source=landing-page&typeform-source=forge.allora.network) page.

Fill out the form and submit your application. 

<Callout>
Input your wallet address that you created in the previous step in the `Allora Wallet Address` field.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Although a discord account is not required to register, participants with a discord account will be able to join exclusive channels in the Allora Discord server to get priorityaccess to help from the Allora Labs team and other participants.

## Model Creation

If your registration is successful, start building your model and preparing it for inference submission to the network.

We've built out some tools to help you get started with model creation. These models are optimized for price prediction, but can be used for other topics as well.

1. [Basic Coin Prediction Node](https://github.com/allora-network/basic-coin-prediction-node)
- Features: 
    - Optimized for price prediction
    - Easy to connect to the Allora Network
    - Built on top of the [Allora Offchain Node](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-offchain-node)

- Downsides:
    - Limited Model Types

2. [Allora MDK](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-model-maker)
- Features:
  - Large set of regression strategies to choose from
  - Easier to customize for volatility and volume predictions

-Downsides:
  - More complex steps to connect to the Allora Network

We offer a comprehensive set of documentation for the [Allora MDK](/devs/workers/deploy-worker/allora-mdk) and [Basic Coin Prediction Node](/devs/workers/walkthroughs/walkthrough-price-prediction-worker) for you to dive into.

## Performance Metrics

We've built out an [Allora Explorer](explorer.allora.network) that displays performance metrics to help you evaluate the success of your model. These metrics are used to score your model in the competition.

Steps:

1. Connect your wallet to the Allora Explorer

![connect-wallet](/explorer-connect.png)

2. Click `Your Topics`

![your-topics](/your-topic.png)

3. Click on a topic to view your performance metrics

![topic-metrics](/topic-stats.png)

- Your `Score` and `ALLO Earned` indicate your overall performance in the topic.

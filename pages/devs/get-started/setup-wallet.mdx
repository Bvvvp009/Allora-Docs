# Setup Wallet

## Create Wallet

Follow the instructions [here](/devs/get-started/cli) to install our CLI tool `allorad`, which is needed to create a wallet.

Prior to executing transactions, a wallet must be created by running:

```shell
allorad keys add testkey
```

Learn more about setting up keys [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/user/run-node/keyring).

Make sure you save your mnemomic and account information safely.

<Callout type="info">
Creating a wallet using `allorad` will generate a wallet address for all currently deployed versions of the Allora Chain (e.g. testnet, local, mainnet). 
</Callout>

## Wallet Recovery

To recover a given wallet's keys, run the following command:

```bash
allorad keys add <wallet name> --recover
```

## Add Faucet Funds
Each network has a different URL to access and request funds from. Please see the faucet URLs for the different networks below:

- **Testnet**: https://faucet.testnet-1.testnet.allora.network/

Enter the Allora Wallet address for the account that needs funding. If you don't have a wallet created yet, follow the instructions above to create one.

## Explorer

- **Testnet**: https://explorer.testnet-1.testnet.allora.network

<Callout>
Check to see that your wallet has been funded after requesting funds from the faucet by clicking the search bar on the top right corner of the explorer UI and entering your account address.
</Callout>

## RPC URL and Chain ID
Each network uses a different RPC URL and Chain ID which are needed to specify which network to run commands on when using specific commands on `allorad`. See a list of all RPC URLs and their respective Chain IDs supported today:

- **Testnet**
    - `RPC_URL`:  
        - https://rpc.ankr.com/allora_testnet
        - https://allora-rpc.testnet.allora.network/
    - `CHAIN_ID`: `allora-testnet-1`

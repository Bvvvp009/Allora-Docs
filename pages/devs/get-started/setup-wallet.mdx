# Setup Wallet

## Create Wallet
Prior to executing transactions, a wallet must be created by running:

```shell
allorad keys add testkey
```

Learn more about setting up keys [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/user/run-node/keyring).

Make sure you save your mnemomic and account information safely.

<Callout type="info">
Creating a wallet using `allorad` will generate a wallet address for all currently deployed versions of the Allora Chain (e.g. testnet, edgenet, local). 
</Callout>

## Add Faucet Funds
Each network has a different URL to access and request funds from. Please see the faucet URLs for the different networks below:

- Testnet: https://faucet.testnet.allora.network
- Edgenet: https://faucet.edgenet.allora.network
- Testnet V2: https://faucet.v2.testnet.allora.network

Enter the Allora Wallet address for the account that needs funding. If you don't have a wallet created yet, follow the instructions above to create one.

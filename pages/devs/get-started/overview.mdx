# Getting Started with Allora

Welcome to the Allora developer's guide! This page will help you get up to speed with the Allora repositories that will be used throughout our documentation and show you how to start contributing to our ecosystem. 

## Overview

Allora is a decentralized network that leverages the power of collective participation in tasks such as data inference, forecasting, and verification. [Contribute](../../community/contribute.mdx) to any of the repositories below to help enhance and grow the Allora ecosystem.

## Allora Chain

The [Allora chain](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain) is a Cosmos Hub chain that forms the core of the Allora network. This repository contains the blockchain's codebase and is useful for validators.

You can use the [`allorad` CLI tool](./cli.mdx#installing-allorad) to query the chain and make transactions.

<Callout>
Some subsections in the Table of Contents below require downloading and installing [`allorad`](./cli.mdx#installing-allorad).
As a general rule, it is suggested to download and install `allorad` for any developer looking to interact with the network.

# Walkthrough: Creating the Ether Price Prediction Topic

The purpose of this tutorial is to create a topic for predictions of the [price of Ether](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum). Workers will need to generate accurate predictions for the price of ETH with a certain cadence, and reputers will need to evaluate these workers and attribute `weights` for them.

**To create a topic for Ether Price prediction, you need to follow the following steps:**

1. A wallet with sufficient funds to at least cover gas. [How to Faucet your Account](./how-to-use-faucet).
2. Create and deploy a Blockless function that triggers node inferences (obtain functionId and method). Check: [How to Create an Inference Generation Function](./create-deploy-inference-generation-function).
3. Create and deploy a Blockless function for the weight adjustment logic (obtain functionId and method). Check: [How to Create and Deploy a Weight Adjustment Function](./create-deploy-weight-adjustment-function).
   1. In this step, you can use our Weight Adjustment Function for Ether price once it is open sourced.
4. Create a topic for your desired subject (ETH). Check: [How to Create a Topic](./how-to-create-topic).

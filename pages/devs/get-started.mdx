# Getting Started with Allora

Welcome to the Allora developer's guide! This page will help you get up to speed with Allora and show you how to start contributing to our ecosystem. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting out, this guide has something for everyone.

## Overview

Allora is a decentralized network that leverages the power of collective participation in tasks such as data inference, forecasting, and verification. [Contribute](/community/contribute) to any of the repositories below to help enhance and grow the Allora ecosystem.
## Key Repositories

Here are the main repositories you'll need to get started with Allora:

### [Allora Inference Base](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-inference-base)

This repository allows model providers to participate in the Allora network. This repo is the base for worker nodes (for providing inferences) and head nodes (which coordinate requests and aggregate results).

### [Allora Chain](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain)

The Allora chain is a Cosmos Hub chain that forms the core of the Allora network. This repository contains the blockchain's codebase and is useful for validators.

You can use the [Allorad CLI tool](/devs/get-started/installation/cli) to query the chain and make transactions.

### [`allocmd` CLI Tool](https://github.com/allora-network/allocmd.git)

# Getting Started with Allora

Welcome to the Allora developer's guide! This page will help you get up to speed with the Allora repositories that will be used throughout our documentation and show you how to start contributing to our ecosystem. 

## Overview

Allora is a decentralized network that leverages the power of collective participation in tasks such as data inference, forecasting, and verification. [Contribute](/community/contribute) to any of the repositories below to help enhance and grow the Allora ecosystem.

## Key Repositories

Here are the main repositories you'll need to get started with Allora:

### Allora Inference Base

The [Allora Inference Base Image](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-inference-base) allows model providers to participate in the Allora network. This repo is the base for worker nodes (for providing inferences) and head nodes (which coordinate requests and aggregate results).

### Allora Chain

The [Allora chain](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain) is a Cosmos Hub chain that forms the core of the Allora network. This repository contains the blockchain's codebase and is useful for validators.

You can use the [Allorad CLI tool](/devs/get-started/installation/cli) to query the chain and make transactions.

### Worker Repositories

The Hugging Face and Price Prediction worker examples below show how to provide inferences for different topics on Allora.

- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-huggingface-walkthrough)
- [Price Prediction](https://github.com/allora-network/basic-coin-prediction-node)

### Allora Consumer Contracts

The [Allora Consumer](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-consumer) Repository shows how to get inferences on-chain via smart contract function execution.

# Consumers
Consumers are entities that utilize the inferences generated by the network. These consumers can take various forms, from individuals or organizations making use of inference data to automated contracts that interact with the blockchain.

## Distinction between Consumers and Consumer Contracts
### Consumers
Consumers are all-encompassing actors that consume inferences on the Allora Network. These could be businesses, developers, data scientists, or any entity interested in the intelligence generated by the network.

### Consumer Contracts
Consumer contracts are blockchain-deployed contracts that consume inferences. These smart contracts automatically interact with the network to retrieve inference data and use it within their logic. For example, a decentralized finance (DeFi) application might use consumer contracts to obtain and act upon real-time price predictions for cryptocurrencies.

## Unsafe Requests
While the Allora Network provides a secure and accurate means of generating and consuming inferences, some consumers may opt for off-chain, direct requests to workers. These are known as unsafe requests, and they have several drawbacks.

**Risks Involved**:

- Workers can alter or disable the request at any time, disrupting the data flow.
- Returned inferences from such requests are not graded and might not match the inferences submitted on-chain.
- The self-improving properties of the Allora Network, which ensure the accuracy and quality of network inferences, are absent in these requests. Consequently, the inferences are unlikely to be as reliable as those found on-chain.

# Upshot Compute Node

## Prerequisites

At the moment, to download the latest version of [Allora Blockless Extension](./allora-b7s-extension), the Github CLI is used.  
Ensure it is installed and running correctly on your machine.

## Building Allora Compute Node Docker image

To ease setup and testing stuff, you can build a Docker image based on the [Allora compute node Dockerfiles](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-inference-base/tree/main/docker).

Clone the [Allora Compute node repository](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-inference-base) and, while at the repo root, run:

```shell
$ docker build --build-arg GH_TOKEN=<GITHUB_TOKEN> --build-arg BLS_EXTENSION_VER=${BLS_ALLORA_EXTENSION_VERSION}  -t allora-compute-node -f ./docker/Dockerfile .
```

where `YOUR_GH_TOKEN` is your Github token, and (optionally)`BLS_EXTENSION_VER` is the release version of the Allora blockless extension to use (it will use latest if not set).

NOTE: The above part can be changed when the repository is public.

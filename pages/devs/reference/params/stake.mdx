# Stake Parameters

> Parameters that affect both kinds of staking featured by Allora

There are two types of staking in Allora Network which run through different staking mechanisms: Validation staking and Reputational staking.

**Validation staking** comes from the popular `staking` module on Cosmos SDK. It is used when staking into Validator nodes.

**Reputational staking** is specific to Allora Network, and it is used to stake into Worker and Reputer nodes.

The parameters for the two types are specified below.

## Reputational Staking

Parameters from the reputational-staking module on Allora Network. These are parameters for staking into reputers and workers.

These parameters are defined as "Chain Parameters" and can be found [here](./chain).

The parameters of concern to reputers in particular are:

- **required_minimum_stake**
- **remove_stake_delay_window**

## Validation Staking

Parameters from the validator-based staking module on Allora Network

**unbonding_time**

Sets the duration for which tokens remain bonded after initiating the unbonding process.

Value: `1814400s` (3 weeks)

Standard value.  
A longer unbonding time enhances security by discouraging malicious actors and stabilizes token supply dynamics, but too long a period may inconvenience users who want to unstake their tokens promptly. This setting achieves a reasonable trade-off.

**max_validators**

Sets the maximum number of validators allowed in the network.

Value: `100`

Standard value.  
It balances decentralization with network scalability. It will be regularly assessed and adjusted based on the network's growth and decentralization.

**max_entries**

Determines the maximum number of entries in the staking transaction pool.

Value: `7`

Standard value.  
It balances the transaction pool size based on expected network demand. It will be regularly assessed and adjusted as the network evolves.

**historical_entries**

Sets the maximum number of historical entries stored in the staking module.

Value: `10000`

Standard value.  
It balances historical data retention with storage efficiency. It will be regularly assessed and adjusted based on storage capabilities and network requirements.

**bond_denom**

Specifies the denomination of the bonded tokens.

Value: `10000`

**min_commission_rate**

Sets the minimum commission rate a validator can charge.

Value: `0.000000000000000000`

Standard value. No minimum commission rate needs to be set. This incentivizes stakers into the validators, offering them higher rewards, and also as part of a community-building strategy.

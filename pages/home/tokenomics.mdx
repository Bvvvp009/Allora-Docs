# Allora Tokenomics

The Allora token (ALLO) is minted by the Allora Network to facilitate the exchange of value by network participants.

## Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW)

The ALLO token incorporates a Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) model to allow token holders the flexibility to choose the fee they pay for inferences generated by the network. This model fosters inclusivity and accessibility by enabling participants to determine the value they assign to the service.

Token holders have the autonomy to decide the amount of ALLO they wish to pay for a given inference, which encourages token holders to contribute to the network's ecosystem according to their perceived value of the service.

Flexible price discovery across topics (less opinionated) - how the market reaches an agreed-upon price 
running an LLM is a different (heterogeneous) resource provision compared to something like ethereum which is homogeneous (each opcode has a fixed price). 
## Token Emissions

### Bitcoin-like Emission Schedule

- Emissions decrease over time, similar to Bitcoin's halving events.
- Creates a transparent and stable token release schedule.
- Ensures continuous rewards for participants in a finite-supply framework.

### Stable APY around Token Unlocks

- Maintains a stable annual percentage yield (APY) for staked tokens, even during unlock periods.
- Reduces the incentive to sell large quantities of tokens during major unlocks, stabilizing token value.
- Promotes long-term staking and active participation in the network by ensuring predictable returns.

## ALLO Token Utility

### Purchasing Inferences

- ALLO tokens can be used to buy inferences generated by the network.
- Uses a PWYW model where consumers choose the ALLO fee for an inference.

### Creating or Participating in Topics

- ALLO tokens are paid for creating topics or participating in the network as a worker.
- The access fee price is variable.

### Staking and Delegating Stake

- Reputers and network validators use ALLO tokens to stake.
- Token holders can [delegate stake](/home/key-terms#delegated-stake) to a reputer or network validator.
- Staking reputers, network validators, and delegating token holders receive rewards in ALLO.

### Reward Distribution

The network uses ALLO tokens to pay out rewards to participants. Participant rewards are explained in-depth in the [Consensus Layer](/home/layers/consensus).

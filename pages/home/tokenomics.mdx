# Allora Tokenomics

The Allora token (ALLO) is minted by the Allora network to facilitate the exchange of value by network participants.

## Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW)

The ALLO token incorporates a Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) model to allow token holders the flexibility to choose the fee they pay for inferences generated by the network. This model fosters inclusivity and accessibility by enabling participants to determine the value they assign to the service. Below are the key aspects of the PWYW model:

- Token holders have the autonomy to decide the amount of ALLO they wish to pay for a given inference.
- By not enforcing a fixed price, the model accommodates users with varying financial capabilities, promoting broader participation in the network.
- The model encourages token holders to contribute to the network's ecosystem according to their perceived value of the service.

## Token Emission Philosophy

### Smooth Bitcoin-like Emission Schedule

- Gradual Reduction: Emissions decrease over time, similar to Bitcoin's halving events.
- Predictable Supply: Creates a transparent and stable token release schedule.
- Long-Term Incentives: Ensures continuous rewards for participants in a finite-supply framework.

### Stable APY around Token Unlocks

- Consistent Yield: Maintains a stable annual percentage yield (APY) for staked tokens, even during unlock periods.
- Market Disincentivization: Reduces the incentive to sell large quantities of tokens during major unlocks, stabilizing token value.
- Retention Encouragement: Promotes long-term staking and active participation in the network by ensuring predictable returns.

# Layers of the Network

The Allora network operates through three distinct layers:

- **Inference Consumption Layer**: Facilitates the exchange of inferences.
- **Forecasting and Synthesis Layer**:
    - Inference workers provide inferences.
    - Forecasting workers use proprietary data and models to predict the accuracy of these inferences.
    - Synthesizes and aggregates results for consumers.
- **Consensus Layer**:
    - Manages rewards and economics for network participants.
    - Ensures a permissionless and secure environment for transactions.

The following sections will build each layer from scratch, show the steps and thought processes behind adding new participants to the network, and ultimately end with the final layer displayed at the bottom of each page.

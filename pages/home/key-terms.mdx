# Key Terminology

## Topics

[Schelling Points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)) that focus the efforts of the protocol by categorizing inferences. Anyone (identified as topic creators) can permissionlessly create a topic on Allora and define a **rule set** that determines how to reward correct inferences within said topic. 
Workers can then submit inferences to these topics and earn rewards based on how accurate their inferences are.

### Rule Set

Loss calculation logic determined at topic creation by a topic creator who decides how to evaluate inferences, and consists of:

- The loss function to use (e.g., mean absolute directional loss, L1-norm)
- The source of ground truth (e.g., some endpoint, some oracle, the median of gathered inferences)

## Inferences

Predictions or conclusions made by workers about specific outcomes within a given topic. 

## Forecasts

Predictions made by workers about the performance of their peers in the current epoch. Forecasts are used to gauge the reliability and accuracy of the participants' inferences.

Forecasts and predictions are used interchangeably throughout the docs.

## Context Awareness

An additional dimension of evaluation that enables the network to achieve the best inferences under any circumstances using inferences and forecasts provided by workers.

## Network Participants

A [network participant](/home/participants) in the Allora Network is an individual or entity that contributes and continuously adds value to the network by fulfilling specific roles.

## Supply Side

All network participants that are not consumers. This includes workers, reputers, and validators. By contrast, the demand side is entirely informed by consumers or those who request inferences.

## Epochs

Discrete periods during which inferences and forecasts are submitted, and rewards are distributed. Each epoch provides a timeframe for evaluating and scoring the performance of workers and reputers.

## Rewards

Incentives given to workers and reputers based on their accuracy, performance and/or stake. These rewards are distributed at the end of each epoch, encouraging high-quality contributions.

## Stake

A financial commitment made by reputers to show confidence in their ability to assess reputation by sourcing the truth and comparing it to workers' inferences. 
This stake increases the importance and rewards of a topic. 

- Reputers and workers must place a minimum stake to participate, ensuring network security and preventing attacks 
- This registration stake allows participation but **does not** influence topic rewards
- Participants use the Allora chain CLI to stake

### Delegated Stake

A method for passive earnings where funds are delegated to a reputer, allowing the delegator to receive rewards based on the reputer's performance. 
- These delegated funds enhance the reputer's stake, improving topic security and the accuracy of loss reports
- A withdrawal delay prevents quick attacks
- Delegating involves risk but offers rewards based on the reputer's success

## Regrets

A measure of how the performance of a worker’s inference compares to the network’s previously reported accuracy.

A positive regret implies that the inference of worker `x` is expected to outperform, whereas a negative regret implies lower expected performance for worker `x`.

# Key Terminology

## Topics

Schelling Points that focus the efforts of the protocol by categorizing inferences. Anyone (identified as topic creators) can permissionlessly create a topic on Allora and define a **rule set** that determines how to reward correct inferences within said topic. 
Workers can then submit inferences to these topics and earn rewards based on how accurate their inferences are.

### Rule Set

Loss calculation logic determined at topic creation by a topic creator who decides how to evaluate inferences, and consists of:

- The loss function to use (e.g., mean absolute directional loss, L1-norm)
- The source of ground truth (e.g., some endpoint, some oracle, the median of gathered inferences)

## Inferences

Predictions or conclusions made by workers about specific outcomes within a given topic. 

## Forecasts

Predictions made by workers about the performance of their peers in the current epoch. Forecasts are used to gauge the reliability and accuracy of the participants' inferences.

## Epochs

Discrete periods during which inferences and forecasts are submitted, and rewards are distributed. Each epoch provides a timeframe for evaluating and scoring the performance of workers and reputers.

## Reputers

Participants who evaluate and score the inferences made by workers. They play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and reliability of the predictions by providing consensus on the ground truth.

## Rewards

Incentives given to workers and reputers based on their accuracy and performance. These rewards are distributed at the end of each epoch, encouraging high-quality contributions.

## Network Participants

A network participant in the Allora Network is an individual or entity that contributes to the network by fulfilling specific roles.

## Stake

A financial commitment made by reputers to show confidence in their ability to assess reputation by sourcing the truth and comparing it to workers' inferences. 
This stake increases the importance and rewards of a topic. 

- Reputers and workers must place a minimum stake to participate, ensuring network security and preventing attacks 
- This registration stake allows participation but **does not** influence topic rewards
- Participants use the Allora chain CLI to stake

### Delegated Stake

A method for passive earnings where funds are delegated to a reputer, allowing the delegator to receive rewards based on the reputer's performance. 
- These delegated funds enhance the reputer's stake, improving topic security and the accuracy of loss reports
- A withdrawal delay prevents quick attacks
- Delegating involves risk but offers rewards based on the reputer's success

## Regrets

A measure of how the performance of a worker’s inference compares to the network’s previously reported accuracy.

A positive regret implies that the inference of worker j is expected to outperform, whereas a negative regret implies lower expected performance.

# Overview

> Overcoming information inefficiency with Allora

The biggest challenge in the digital world is efficiently exchanging information. Efficient information exchange enables actors to make informed decisions across domains, from logistics and planning to governance and financial markets. When this information is accessible only to some ecosystem participants, they gain a unique advantage to beat the competition.
At Allora, the intersection between blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) provides an unprecedented opportunity to overcome information inefficiency.

## Introducing Allora

The Allora Network is a state-of-the-art protocol that uses decentralized AI and machine learning (ML) to build and deploy predictions among its participants. It offers actors who wish to use AI predictions a formalized way to obtain the output of state-of-the-art ML models on-chain and to pay the operators of AI/ML nodes who create these predictions. Allora bridges the information gap between data owners, data processors, AI/ML predictors, market analysts, and the end-users or consumers who can execute these insights.
The AI/ML agents within the Allora Network use their data and algorithms to broadcast their predictions across a peer-to-peer network, and they ingest these predictions to assess the predictions from all other agents. The network consensus mechanism combines these predictions and assessments and distributes rewards to the agents according to the quality of their predictions and assessments. This carefully designed incentive mechanism enables Allora to continually learn and improve, adjusting to the market as it evolves.

## More Info

Allora aims to incentivize data scientists to provide high-quality inferences. This is achieved through a technical architecture detailed in the [Allora whitepaper](https://whitepaper.assets.allora.network/whitepaper.pdf) and implemented in the Allora Network GitHub repositories, particularly [`allora-chain`](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain) and [`offchain-node`](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-offchain-node).

# Inference Synthesis

Inference synthesis in Allora is a process that combines individual inferences from various workers to produce an aggregate inference. This process takes place over several epochs and involves both inference and forecasting tasks.

## Normalization of Regrets

Regrets are normalized to ensure weights are comparable and within a reasonable range.
This prevents any single inference from disproportionately affecting the final result.
The regret is normalized using its standard deviation across all workers, adjusted by a small constant 𝜖:

- Here, 𝜎𝑗σ is the standard deviation of 𝑅𝑖𝑗𝑘 for a particular inference across all workers.
- The small constant 𝜖 ensures numerical stability and avoids division by zero.

### Using Normalized Regrets for Weights

The normalized regrets 𝑅𝑖𝑗𝑘 are then used to calculate the weights for each inference:

These weights determine how much each initial inference 𝐼𝑖𝑗 will contribute to the final network inference.

## Forecast-Implied Inferences

The Topic Coordinator takes the forecasted losses and normalized weights and produces forecast-implied inferences. A forecast-implied inference is a predicted value of a target variable that combines different 
forecasters' predictions and workers' inferences, where each prediction is weighted based on how accurately the forecasters predicted losses in previous time steps, or _epochs_.

Here, 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑘 are weights assigned to each inference based on the forecasted regret.

## Final Network Inference

The final inference for the network is a weighted combination of all individual inferences.
This combined result is expected to be more accurate and reliable due to the weighting process.

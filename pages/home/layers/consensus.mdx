# Consensus

The Allora Network is built as a hub chain on Cosmos. Network Validators handle fees and distribute rewards to different network participants. 

Consumers pay fees in the native network token to the Validators in return for inferences.

## Differentiated Incentives

Each network participant has a different reward mechanism to incentivize the growth and security of the network.
- Workers are rewarded based on the quality of their inferences
- Reputers are rewarded based on the accuracy of their data and their stake in the network 
- Network Validators are rewarded solely based on their stake in the network

For workers and reputers, we'll explain why a 'naive' approach to calculating rewards is insufficient, how rewards are calculated for the total number of actors within each individual participant, and finally how total rewards are distributed between participants.

### The 'Naive' Approach

A naive approach involves making predictions or decisions based solely on raw data, without considering any additional context. 
This simplistic method disregards supplementary information that could refine or enhance the prediction, relying only on the basic inputs available.

#### Workers

- A 'naive' inference is a prediction made by the network without including any information from forecasting workers.
- To create this naive inference, the weights of all forecast-implied inferences are set to zero. Essentially, itâ€™s like ignoring everything the forecasting tasks have added and just using the raw inferences.

#### Reputers

- Reputers are scored based on their accuracy in reporting the ground truth. 
- The naive method involves calculating the stake-weighted average of all losses reported by a reputer. Rewards are then added to the reputers' stakes based on their performance.

_**Both Reputers and Workers could theoretically be scored using only a 'naive' network solution, however, this is not sufficient...**_

Let's dive into why in the following sections.

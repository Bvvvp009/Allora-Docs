# Calculating Topic Reward Distribution Across all Network Participants

Now that we've explained the mechanisms behind distributing rewards for the actors of each network participant, let's dive in to how topic rewards are distributed across:
- inference workers
- forecast workers 
- reputers

The common objective of the calculated reward distribution across the network is to incentivize decentralization.

## Key Factors
### Modified Entropy

Entropy, in this context, is a measure of how spread out the rewards are among participants. We calculate entropy for each class of tasks (inference, forecast, reputer), which helps in determining how decentralized the reward distribution is.

Higher entropy means rewards are more evenly spread out across all participants.
</Callout>

The modified entropy for each class of tasks is given by the following equations:

**Inference**

$$
F_i = - \sum_j f_{ij} \ln \left( f_{ij} \left( \frac{N_i^{\text{eff}}}{N_i} \right)^\beta \right)
$$

Where:
- $$ F_i $$ is the entropy for inference workers.
- $$ \sum_j $$ means we add up the values for all inference workers $$ j $$.
- $$ f_{ij} $$ is the fraction of rewards for the $$ j $$-th inference worker.
- $$ N_i^{\text{eff}} $$ is the effective number of inference workers (a fair count to prevent cheating).
- $$ N_i $$ is the total number of inference workers.
- $$ \beta $$ is a constant that helps adjust the calculation.

The formula for forecast workers ($$ G_i $$) and reputers ($$ H_i $$) is similar:

$$
G_i = - \sum_k f_{ik} \ln \left( f_{ik} \left( \frac{N_f^{\text{eff}}}{N_f} \right)^\beta \right)
$$

$$
H_i = - \sum_m f_{im} \ln \left( f_{im} \left( \frac{N_r^{\text{eff}}}{N_r} \right)^\beta \right)
$$

Where:
- $$ G_i $$ and $$ H_i $$ are the entropies for forecast workers and reputers, respectively.
- $$ \sum_k $$ and $$ \sum_m $$ mean we add up the values for all forecast workers $$ k $$ and all reputers $$ m $$.
- $$ f_{ik} $$ and $$ f_{im} $$ are the fractions of rewards for the $$ k $$-th forecast worker and the $$ m $$-th reputer.
- $$ N_f^{\text{eff}} $$ and $$ N_r^{\text{eff}} $$ are the effective numbers of forecast workers and reputers.
- $$ N_f $$ and $$ N_r $$ are the total numbers of forecast workers and reputers.


where we have defined modified reward fractions per class as:

$$
f_{ij} = \frac{\tilde{u}_{ij}}{\sum_j \tilde{u}_{ij}}, \quad f_{ik} = \frac{\tilde{v}_{ik}}{\sum_k \tilde{v}_{ik}}, \quad f_{im} = \frac{\tilde{w}_{im}}{\sum_m \tilde{w}_{im}}
$$

### Effective Number of Participants

To prevent manipulation of the reward system against sybil attacks, we calculate the effective number of participants (actors). It ensures that the reward distribution remains fair even if someone tries to game the system.

$$
N_i^{\text{eff}} = \frac{1}{\sum_j f_{ij}^2}, \quad N_f^{\text{eff}} = \frac{1}{\sum_k f_{ik}^2}, \quad N_r^{\text{eff}} = \frac{1}{\sum_m f_{im}^2}
$$

Where:
- $$ N_i^{\text{eff}} $$, $$ N_f^{\text{eff}} $$, and $$ N_r^{\text{eff}} $$ are the effective numbers of inference workers, forecast workers, and reputers.
- The fractions $$ f_{ij} $$, $$ f_{ik} $$, and $$ f_{im} $$ are squared and then added up for each type of worker.


## Putting It All Together

### Dividing the Pie: Who Gets What?

We take the total reward for a task and split it among the different worker types based on our entropy calculations. Here's the formula:

$$
U_i = \frac{(1 - \chi)\gamma F_i E_{i,t}}{F_i + G_i + H_i}, \quad V_i = \frac{\chi \gamma G_i E_{i,t}}{F_i + G_i + H_i}, \quad W_i = \frac{H_i E_{i,t}}{F_i + G_i + H_i}
$$

In simpler terms:
- $$ U_i $$ is the reward for inference workers.
- $$ V_i $$ is the reward for forecast workers.
- $$ W_i $$ is the reward for reputers.
- $$ E_{i,t} $$ is the total reward for the task at time $$ t $$.
- $$ \chi $$ is a factor that adjusts how much reward goes to forecast workers.
- $$ \gamma $$ is a balance factor to keep everything fair.
- $$ F_i $$, $$ G_i $$, and $$ H_i $$ are the entropies for inference workers, forecast workers, and reputers.

### How Good is the Forecast? Checking the Predictions

We check how good the forecast is using a score called $$ T_i $$:

$$
T_i = \log L_i^- - \log L_i
$$

Where:
- $$ T_i $$ is the performance score for the forecast.
- $$ L_i^- $$ is the network loss without the forecast task.
- $$ L_i $$ is the network loss with the forecast task.

We then use this score to decide how much the forecast workers should get. The more accurate their predictions, the higher their reward:

$$
\tau_i \equiv \frac{T_i - \min \left( 0, \sum_j T_{ij} \right)}{\sum_j T_{ij}}
$$

Where:
- $$ \tau_i $$ is the adjusted score for the forecast task.
- $$ T_{ij} $$ is the performance score for each forecast worker.

This score is then adjusted to fit within a specific range:

$$
\chi = \begin{cases}
    0.1 & \text{if } \tau_i < 0, \\
    0.4 \tau_i + 0.1 & \text{if } 0 \leq \tau_i < 1, \\
    0.5 & \text{if } \tau_i \geq 1.
\end{cases}
$$

### The Balance Factor

We use a balance factor $$ \gamma $$ to make sure everything stays fair:

$$
\gamma = \frac{F_i + G_i}{(1 - \chi)F_i + \chi G_i}
$$

Where:
- $$ \gamma $$ ensures that the rewards are balanced correctly.

By using these methods, we can ensure that rewards are spread out fairly and encourage everyone to contribute their best work.

# Consensus: Reputers

Reputers are rewarded based on their accuracy comparative to consensus (the other reputers providing data for a topic) and stake, with added functionality to prevent centralization of rewards caused by reputers with larger stakes.

## Problem: Runaway Centralization
1. **Stake-Weighted Average:**
- Reputers are actors who report on how accurate certain predictions or inferences are against the ground truth.
- Normally, we might average the accuracy (or "losses") they report, but give more weight to reputers with bigger stakes (more reputation).
- This means reputers with more stake have more influence on the consensus (agreed-upon truth).
2. **Runaway Effect:**
- The problem is that reputers with higher stakes get more rewards, which further increases their stakes.
- This creates a cycle where the rich get richer, leading to centralization. A few reputers end up controlling most of the influence and rewards, which is unfair and unhealthy for the system.

## Solution: Adjusted Stake
1. **Adjusted Stake:**
- To prevent runaway centralization, we adjust how much weight each reputer's stake has when setting the consensus.
- Instead of using the full stake for weighting, we use an adjusted version that doesn’t let any one reputer dominate.
2. **How It Works:**
- The formula for adjusted stake ensures that if a reputer's stake goes above a certain level, it doesn’t keep increasing their weight.
- It levels the playing field, so reputers with smaller stakes still have some influence.

$$\hat{S}_{im} = \min \left( \frac{N_r a_{im} S_{im}}{\sum_m a_{im} S_{im}}, 1 \right)$$

Where:
- $$Nr$$​ is the number of reputers.
- $$a_{im}$$ is a listening coefficient, which is a measure of how much the network considers each reputer's input, based on their past performance.
- $$S_{im}$$​ is the original stake.

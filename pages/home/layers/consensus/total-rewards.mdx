## Topic vs Chain Security

## Total Reward Distribution

### Validator Rewards

Validator rewards are divided from the total allocation of 25% based on how much **stake** a given validator has in the network comparative to the overall stake of all validators in the network.

### Topic Rewards

Topic rewards for a single topic are divided from the total allocation of 75% based on how much '**weight**' the topic has.

#### Understanding Topic Weight

- Weight is like a score that shows how important or valuable a topic is.
- This weight is based on two things:
    - How much reputer stake it has
    - How much revenue the topic generates
- The formula for calculating weight looks at both these factors equally
- The weight is averaged over time to keep it stable and fair, so sudden changes donâ€™t affect it too much.

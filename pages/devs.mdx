> Learn how your applications can consume streams of inferences from the Allora Network

You can seamlessly integrate Allora Network's inferences into your blockchain applications following these steps:

1. **Create a Topic**: start by [creating a topic on the Allora appchain](how-to-create-a-topic). This attracts data scientists with relevant domain expertise who are incentivized to provide high-quality and ever-improving inferences.
2. **Deploy an Adapter**: Once inferences are collected on the appchain, [stream them to your target blockchain](adding-price-data). This is essential for powering your applications. Check if [an adapter is already deployed](deployments) on your target chain and, if not, [deploy one](deploying-an-adapter-to-an-evm-target-chain).
3. **Verify Data**: Bring your data to the deployed adapter for verification. This can be done in two ways, depending on your topic's structure:
   - For topics without subtopics: [submit data without specifying `extraData`](adding-price-data).
   - For topics with subtopics: [submit data with `extraData`](adding-specific-price-data).
4. **Integrate Data into Applications**: you can now start using the verified data in your applications on the desired blockchain.

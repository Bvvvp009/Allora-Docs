# Explore Allora
 
Allora is an open-source, permissionless marketplace for intelligence.

Allora brings together
- Consumers who pay for and acquire inferences or expertise to be revealed
- Workers who reveal inferences
- Reputers who determine how accurate workers are after a ground truth is revealed
- Validators who secure protocol state, history, and reward distributions

With these ingredients, Allora is able to improve itself over time and produce inferences that are more accurate than the most accurate participant.

Allora consumers are currently live on Sepolia and Arbitrum One, and will be deployed to additional chains.

Here we'll help you find exactly what you're looking for.
